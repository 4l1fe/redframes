### Questions

- Did you encounter any bugs? Anything unexpected?
- Any verbs you would want renamed?
- Any other verbs I'm missing?
- Any missing properties/magics for DataFrame?
- Any super super unclear?
- .rename / Continue pandas format, or do `{"New": "Old"}`?
- Summarize: continue to use tuple? Or change to dict? `{new: {"old": stat}}`
- Should I totally get rid of index rows (in jupyter html output display)?
- Should `save` be a verb/method? Or keep in `io` namespace?
- Should I add a `log` method (that would print out for shape and column names at each step)?
- Please try with visualization!
- Please try with sklearn (I think it works, took a while to gerry-rig it)!!
